# Modular Prime Rattling Framework

This project implements a novel mathematical model—**Rattling Agents in Modular Prime Fields**—which explores the emergent spatial structure of prime number distributions using entropy fields, harmonic alignments, and biased stochastic motion.

## 📖 Paper

The accompanying research paper outlines the full theory, formal lemmas, conjectures, and simulation results. It is formatted for LaTeX and ready for academic submission.

## 🧠 Theory Summary

- **Modular Matrix Construction**: Prime indices are mapped into a 2D modular field.
- **Entropy Field**: Prime scarcity is quantified via local entropy.
- **Rattling Agents**: Biased walkers traverse entropy gradients.
- **Harmonic Alignment**: Zones aligned to the golden ratio φ form resonant bands.
- **Prediction Field**: Combines entropy and φ-alignment to forecast probable prime zones.

## 🔬 Simulation

This repo includes a complete Python simulation to visualize:

- Modular structure
- Entropy fields
- Rattling path density
- Entropy curvature
- Twin prime influence
- φ-alignment
- Composite predicted prime zones

### 🔧 Requirements
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### ▶ Run the simulation
```bash
python modular_prime_rattling_simulation.py
```

This will generate `modular_prime_rattling_analysis.png` with 7 panels summarizing the system.
